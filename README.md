> "This submission encapsulates the comprehensive practical implementation of Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing, essential for optimizing data input for Machine Learning models. The accompanying GitHub repository is professionally structured and contains the following deliverables:
>
> * **`Data_Preprocessing_Task.ipynb` 🧪:** A dedicated Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook utilizing **Python, Pandas, and NumPy** to demonstrate mastery of the required steps:
>    * Exploration and Null Handling: Identifying data types and implementing **imputation (mean/median)** strategies to manage missing values.
>    * Feature Engineering: Converting categorical data to numerical formats using appropriate **encoding techniques (Label and/or One-Hot Encoding)**.
>    * Feature Scaling: Applying **Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)** and/or **Standardization (Z-Score Scaling)** to prepare numerical features for model training.
>    * Outlier Management: **Visualization using Boxplots (Matplotlib/Seaborn)** for detection and subsequent removal or capping of outliers.
>
> * **`README.md` 📝:** Comprehensive documentation detailing the project's scope, execution steps, and concise answers to the theoretical interview questions, confirming a thorough understanding of data preprocessing concepts.
>
> The project confirms proficiency in cleaning and preparing raw datasets (e.g., Titanic Dataset) and ensuring features are optimally conditioned, which is critical for maximizing subsequent model accuracy and performance. 🚀"
